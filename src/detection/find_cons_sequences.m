function seq = find_cons_sequences(A)
%FINDCONSSEQUENCES
%
% Finds consecutive sequences of anomalies

A(end+1)=2;   % adds new endpoint to very end of A so code picks up end of last group of consecutive values
I_1=find(diff(A)~=1);  % finds where sequences of consecutive numbers end
% [m,n]=size(I_1); 
n=length(I_1);% finds dimensions of I_1 i.e. how many sequences of consecutive numbers you have
startpoint=1;    % sets start index at the first value in your array
seq=cell(n,1);  % had to preallocate because without, it only saved last iteration of the for loop below
% used n because this array is a row vector
for i=1:n
    End_Idx=I_1(i);   %set end index
    seq{i,1}=A(startpoint:End_Idx);  %finds sequences of consecutive numbers and assigns to cell array
    startpoint=End_Idx+1;   %update start index for the next consecutive sequence
end
