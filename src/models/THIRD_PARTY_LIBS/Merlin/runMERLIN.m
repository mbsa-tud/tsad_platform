%             excluded region applied after each pick to all subsequent
%             choices of motifs and neighbors. Outliers are picked first,
%             followed by the top motif and its neighbors, followed by the

%             picking outliers as motifs on short time series.
%
%             The distance between a motif and its neighbor must be less than
%             two times the distance between a motif and its nearest
%             neighbor. This is not strict enough to guarantee any causal
%             relation, and in cases of weak matches, neighbors may vary
