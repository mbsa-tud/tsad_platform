An implementation of the "HOT SAX" algorithm.
HOTSAX is used to detect anomalies (discords) in timeseries data.

The meaning of the parameters are in HOTSAX.m

timeseries2symbol.m is what we called "SAX" which can transform timeseries data into symbols.
The usage of the HOTSAX function can be seen in HOTSAX_example.m
The dataset used in the example is from "Space Shuttle dataset".


The copyright of this function can be seen in the code.
