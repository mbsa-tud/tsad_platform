function [out index] = slidingavg(in, N)

%   OUTPUT_ARRAY = SLIDINGAVG(INPUT_ARRAY, N)
%
%  The function 'slidingavg' implements a one-dimensional filtering, applying a sliding window to a sequence. Such filtering replaces the center value in
%  the window with the average value of all the points within the window. When the sliding window is exceeding the lower or upper boundaries of the input
%  vector INPUT_ARRAY, the average is computed among the available points. Indicating with nx the length of the the input sequence, we note that for values
%  of N larger or equal to 2*(nx - 1), each value of the output data array are identical and equal to mean(in).
%
%  *  The input argument INPUT_ARRAY is the numerical data array to be processed.
%  *  The input argument N  is the number of neighboring data points to average over for each point of IN.
%
%  *  The output argument OUTPUT_ARRAY is the output data array.
