This algorithm is modified from paper:
Leng, Mingwei, Xiaoyun Chen, and Longjie Li. "Variable length methods for detecting anomaly patterns in time series." 

Program "DTW_AF" will compute anomaly factor which defined in the mentioned paper. The different way is that, 
this program will not output boolean value for anomaly pattern identification. We only compute the anomaly score to represent the anomaly level.
