-Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT dataset)
The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images.  
	
-Description
Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal and anomaly. 
The database of 181 SPECT image sets (patients) was processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images.
