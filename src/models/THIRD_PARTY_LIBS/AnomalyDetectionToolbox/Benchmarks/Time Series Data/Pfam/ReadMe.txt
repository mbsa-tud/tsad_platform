This data set is collected for evaluating your symbolic sequence data anomaly detection algorithms. Different protein families are constructed by different structure. If one unseen symbolic sequence is obviously different to the sequences of database, the unseen symbolic sequence can be considered as anomaly. Normal sequence data set includes 28265 RVP(PF00077) protein sequences as normal database. Unseen sequence data set includes 50 normal sequences and 50 abnormal sequences from other protein families, viz., HCV(PF01543), TetR_C_7(PF14246), and NADH5_C(PF06455). 

Those symbolic sequences are queried from Pfam [4]. You need to cite the paper if your research includes this dataset
