This data set includes a set of normal synthetic (sine) waves for learning normal model, 
and a set of synthetic unseen waves for testing your model. The unseen data set includes sine, discord sine, cosine, and square waves.
A feasible algorithm should identify sine waves in unseen data set as normal, and identify others as abnormal.

Your algorithms should be able to deal with waves without regular length. Those sequences should read line by line. 
You can use 'cellReader' in 'util' folder to parse the csv file to a cell array.
